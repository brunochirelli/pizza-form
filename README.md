# The Project

I'm so glad and thankful to receive this opportunity to show some of my technical frontend skills with React.

My goal was not to deliver the perfect app, but the most I could do in 3 days.

I hope that you could get exciting looking at the project as I was excited about doing it.

## Goals

The goal of this project is:

- Handle routing
- CSS-in-JS
- Store state with Redux and persist it
- Apply layouts
- Use some third-party-libraries
- Show some UX skills

## Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Redux Toolkit & Redux Persist
- React Router DOM
- Styled-components
- Material UI
- Prettier, Stylelint, Eslint
- JSON Server

# The App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn develop`

Runs the app in the development mode with JSON server.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Server is open on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### `yarn server`

Runs the server.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn lint`

Lints styles and components using stylelint, prettier and eslint.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
